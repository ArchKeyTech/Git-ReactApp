# Git-ReactApp
A full-stack app which allows one to search for existing Github or Gitlab users via a search engine.

The app makes calls to the github and gitlab APIs based on the user's input name query, then returns
valid usernames which match the name entered.

Once a username is clicked, the app then displays the user info for that particular account as well
as their repositories info

## How to install the app

Download the ZIP file of the code or Git Clone from your terminal. Then, navigate to the directory of the downloaded file, inside 'Git-ReactApp'. Using your text editor or your terminal, type` npm install`. This will setup the node_modules folder (make sure you are in the same directory where the package.json file is located)

## Launching the app

Once the install is complete, run `npm start` to launch the app in development mode.
This will launch the app in the browser with server [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
