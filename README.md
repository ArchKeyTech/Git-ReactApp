# Git-ReactApp
A full-stack app which allows one to search for existing Github or Gitlab users via a search engine.

The app makes calls to the github and gitlab APIs based on the user's input name query, then returns
valid usernames which match the name entered.

Once a username is clicked, the app then displays the user info for that particular account as well
as their repositories info
